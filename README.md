Hello,

There it is my first project, where I used React and Bootstrap. This is a simply Quiz App, where user can pick one of two categories. I mostly focused during writing code on life cycle in React.
At the moment I spend only few hours on study React, but I wanted to check how much this framework can offer. In the nearest future I have a goal to mainly study React and make a new, more expanded projects.

You can try my Quiz App here -> https://piotr-kuras97.github.io/react-quiz-app/
